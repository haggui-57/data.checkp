Data Definition Language

Allows the specification of not only a set of relations but 
also information about each relation, including:

 The schema for each relation.
 The domain of values associated with each attribute.
 Integrity constraints
 The set of indices to be maintained for each relations.
 Security and authorization information for each relation.
 The physical storage structure of each relation on disk.

Domain Types in SQL

char(n). Fixed length character string, with user-specified length n.
 varchar(n). Variable length character strings, with user-specified
maximum length n.
 int. Integer (a finite subset of the integers that is machinedependent).
 smallint. Small integer (a machine-dependent subset of the integer
domain type).
 numeric(p,d). Fixed point number, with user-specified precision of
p digits, with n digits to the right of decimal point.
 real, double precision. Floating point and double-precision
floating point numbers, with machine-dependent precision.
 float(n). Floating point number, with user-specified precision of at
least n digits.

Create Table Construct

 An SQL relation is defined using the create table command:data.language

:
create table r (A1 D1, A2 D2, ..., An Dn,
(integrity-constraint1),
...,
(integrity-constraintk))
 r is the name of the relation
 each Ai is an attribute name in the schema of relation r
 Di is the data type of values in the domain of attribute Ai
 Example:
create table branch
(branch_name char(15) not null,
branch_city char(30),
assets integer)
